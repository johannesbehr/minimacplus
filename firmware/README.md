This is my Odroid-GO port of the minimacplus FW you can find here:
https://spritesmods.com/?art=minimacplus

The B-Key toogles the  virtual keyboard.

To use it you need at least two files on your SD-Card:
- one *.rom file
- at leats on disk image (Might be *.image, *.drv, *.hfv, *.raw or *.dsk)

Put both files in a folder "/roms/macplus" on the SD-Root!

The Rom file could be "1986-03 - 4D1F8172 - MacPlus v3.ROM" from
OS-6-06-a15-90-08-01-Ray-Ban.zip which you can get here: https://www.macintoshrepository.org/7038-all-macintosh-roms-68k-ppc-

The disk Image could be "System Tools.image" from
OS-6-06-a15-90-08-01-Ray-Ban.zip which you can get here: https://www.macintoshrepository.org/1778-mac-system-6-x

Feel free to create your one disks with all the nice programs you can find on the web, you can use up to 4 disk images (each maximal 20 MB) at the same time. You can use this cool emulator https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/ to prepare your disks on the pc and then put them on your go :)

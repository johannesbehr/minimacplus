This is my Odroid-GO port of the minimacplus FW you can find here:
https://spritesmods.com/?art=minimacplus

To use it you need two files on your SD-Card:

- mac.rom => Get "1986-03 - 4D1F8172 - MacPlus v3.ROM" from here: https://www.macintoshrepository.org/7038-all-macintosh-roms-68k-ppc-
- mac_hd.raw => Create it by your self with mess0161b, wich you can find here: https://www.mamedev.org/oldrel.html

Put both files in a folder "/roms/macplus" on the SD-Root!
